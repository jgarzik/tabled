Setup instructions
==================

*) Make sure a CLD is running somewhere on the network, and has an SRV record,
   which typically looks like this:

[root@table1 ~]# host -t srv _cld._udp
_cld._udp.phx2.ex.com has SRV record 10 50 8081 pacman.phx2.ex.com.
_cld._udp.phx2.ex.com has SRV record 10 50 8081 maika.phx2.ex.com.
[root@table1 ~]# 

   If this does not work, STOP NOW. Then, talk to your DNS administrator.

   Also, make sure that your hostname has a domain. We don't want to search
   for CLD in the world-wide DNS root, do we?

   Make sure CLD is up (run "cldcli" to verify).

*) Another thing to set up in DNS is a wildcard host for the system where
   tabled will run. Unlike the SRV records of CLD, this is optional, but
   these days applications may presume that it exists. Here's the way it's
   done in ISC BIND:

emus3           IN      A       192.168.128.9
                IN      TXT     "Dell C8WQMC1"
                IN      AAAA    fec0::1:219:b9ff:fe58:7ad6
*.emus3         IN      CNAME   emus3

   All examples on Google say FQDN is required, and most presume aliasing
   of A and AAAA records, but BIND 9 eats the above fine.

*) Copy configuration file from doc/etc.tabled.conf to /etc/tabled.conf
   and edit to suit (see configurable items below). Notice that the file
   looks like XML, but is not really. In particular, names of elements are
   case-sensitive.

*) The tabled writes its pid to /var/run/tabled.pid by default.
   If you don't like the location, change it with <PID> tag.

*) Create/choose TDB data directory, where Berkeley DB stores
   data and metadata. Change this location with <TDB> tag.

*) Assign the cell name:

	<Cell>ultracart3</Cell>

   Currently, a tabled process scans its cell, finds all other tabled
   instances, and attempts to replicate its database to/from them.
   In short, use one cell per business application.

   Cell name defaults to "default", so you can leave this element unset,
   but don't do it. Any name, even "qwerty", is better than the default.

*) Select the port to listen, if desired. This is done using the <Listen>
   element:

	<Listen>
		<Port>80</Port>
	</Listen>

   Default is port 80, which you should use unless the system in question
   hosts an unrelated webserver too. This is because some libraries, such
   as ancient Google Boto, may have bugs that prevent them from talking to
   ports other than 80 (for unencrypted HTTP). If your target clients are
   bug-free, use anything you like. The 8080 is a popular choice.

*) Initialize TDB, the metadata database.  Load user/password pairs
   into TDB, using tdbadm utility.  The user/password pairs are
   presented to tdbadm stdin in the following text format:

	username <TAB> password <NL>

   Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

*) start the daemon!
