Setup instructions
==================

*) Make sure a CLD is running somewhere on the network, and has an SRV record,
   which typically looks like this:

[root@table1 ~]# host -t srv _cld._udp
_cld._udp.phx2.ex.com has SRV record 10 50 8081 pacman.phx2.ex.com.
_cld._udp.phx2.ex.com has SRV record 10 50 8081 maika.phx2.ex.com.
[root@table1 ~]# 

   If this does not work, set up CLD before proceeding.

   Also, make sure that your hostname has a domain. We don't want to search
   for CLD in the DNS root, do we?

*) Copy configuration file from doc/etc.tabled.conf to /etc/tabled.conf
   and edit to suit (see configurable items below).

*) The tabled writes its pid to /var/run/tabled.pid by default.
   If you don't like the location, change it with <PID> tag.

*) Create/choose TDB data directory, where Berkeley DB stores
   data and metadata. Change this location with <TDB> tag.

*) Select the port to listen, if desired. This is done using the <Listen>
   element:

	<Listen>
		<Port>80</Port>
	</Listen>

*) Initialize TDB, the metadata database.  Load user/password pairs
   into TDB, using tdbadm utility.  The user/password pairs are
   presented to tdbadm stdin in the following text format:

	username <TAB> password <NL>

   Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

*) start the daemon!
