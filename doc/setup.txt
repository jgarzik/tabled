Setup instructions
==================

*) Copy configuration file from doc/etc.tabled.conf to /etc/tabled.conf
   and edit to suit (see configurable items below).

*) The tabled writes its pid to /var/run/tabled.pid by default.
   If you don't like the location, change it with <PID> tag.

*) Create/choose data directory, where raw object data is stored.
   This is set with the <Data> tag.

*) Create/choose TDB data directory, where Berkeley DB stores
   data and metadata. Change this location with <TDB> tag.

*) Select the port to listen, if desired. This is done using the <Listen>
   element:

	<Listen>
		<Port>80</Port>
	</Listen>

*) Initialize TDB, the metadata database.  Load user/password pairs
   into TDB, using tdbadm utility.  The user/password pairs are
   presented to tdbadm stdin in the following text format:

	username <TAB> password <NL>

   Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

*) start the daemon!
