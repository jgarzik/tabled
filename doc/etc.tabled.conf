  The usual practice is to set a fixed TDBRepPort (8083) because this
  permits to configure a firewall easily. Remember that replication
  has no authentication and authorization whatsoever for now!
  When running two test instances on the same host, you may use "auto".
  But if so, do not forget to set replication instances with TDBRepName.
  By default, a hostname serves fine as an instance name, port is "auto".

  The clause <CLD> is not to be used in production configurations.
  Normally, tabled finds CLD from SRV records in DNS, and then finds
  storage nodes from CLD. We only use such clauses in order to bootstrap
  a build of tabled. Consider them undocumented and a subject to change
  or removal at any time.
