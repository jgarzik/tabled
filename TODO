buckets
=======
- support bucket ACL query or edit (?acl query param)

- make sure to escape lt/gt/amp in XML output (list buckets, list keys)


objects
=======
- support object ACL query or edit (?acl query param)

- store as compressed data (unless there is little advantage to doing so,
  such as with already-compressed data)

  headers
  -------
  - x-amz-meta-
  - x-amz-date

  - Content-Encoding
  - Content-MD5 (note: base64-encoded, not just hex string)

  - Range
  - Content-Range


system
======
- read list of error codes, and attempt to apply as many as possible
  to the existing codebase (re-analyze every year or two after that)

- SOAP?  Amazon forums say only 1% of userbase uses this, so maybe not

- request logging (basic, and to a specified bucket)
